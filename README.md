# Machine Learning Notebooks

A collection of machine learning projects and experiments, ranging from **fundamental algorithms implemented from scratch** to **applied ML workflows on real-world datasets**.  
This repository serves as both a learning resource and a showcase of different approaches to solving machine learning problems.

## Repository Structure

Each folder contains a self-contained project with code, data processing steps, and (where applicable) explanations or reports:

- **Detecting Historical Anachronisms with Zero-Shot Classification**  
  Using transformer-based zero-shot models to identify temporal inconsistencies in text.

- **Gait Condition Classification using LSTMs**  
  Sequence modeling of gait data with LSTMs to classify medical conditions.

- **IMDB_Movie_Reviews_(binary_sentiment_classification)**  
  Sentiment analysis (positive vs. negative) on the IMDB dataset.

- **MAGIC Gamma Telescope â€“ Gamma vs. Hadron Classification**  
  Supervised classification task to distinguish between gamma rays and hadron events.

- **R_Machine_Learning_Implementations**  
  Classic ML algorithms (e.g., k-NN, regression, classification) implemented from scratch in R.

- **Sentence Transformer model for semantic similarity**  
  Fine-tuning sentence transformers for semantic textual similarity tasks.

- **Using ConvNeXt to Detect Brain Tumors**  
  Applying ConvNeXt (a modern CNN architecture) to classify medical images.

## Goals of this Repository

- Explore machine learning concepts through **hands-on projects**.  
- Implement algorithms **from scratch** to understand their inner workings.  
- Apply **state-of-the-art ML models** to diverse datasets.  
- Provide reproducible notebooks for experimentation and learning.
